# Enigma in Java
Hello! This repo will be documenting my development process for my own Enigma Machine.

As for some background info, the Enigma machine as a glorified typewriter used by the Germans in WWII that would encrypt their communications.
The device was a purely mechancical machine made up of rotors and plugboards that would crosswire electrical signals from lettes on the keyboard.

The goal of this project is to emulate the machine in Java.

I aim to document my design notes and resources used to finish the project.

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1170oms8HfjgtowOE7sFH_ehGb-ie7O3v/view?usp=sharing) is a little notebook I wrote for part of my notetaking and design process.
